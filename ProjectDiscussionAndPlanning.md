We'll plan to text for more immediate communication and use the repo and email for sharing files, progress, etc.

We'll plan to meet once per week for around one hour to discuss next steps and progress from the previous week.

We'll discuss everyone's progress at each meeting and try to assign the next steps evenly between us. 

Our goal is to create an agent based model that can simulate the interactions between the farmers, bandits, and soilders. We'll be sure to share different ideas for the different tasks and work together to make sure everyone is on the same page. 

We are going to wait on exactly what roles we are going to take until we can meet with the fourth member of the group. We plan to assign roles at our first meeting in a couple of days.

By next week we will have met once to discuss the different goals for the model and the different parts of the project each of us will focus on.

Our first meeting will be at 5:00pm on Sunday at the Library.
